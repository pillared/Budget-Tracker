# Budget-Tracker
Decided to analyze my monthly income and spending from my checking account and visualize it.
Running the budgettracker.ipynb file reads a csv file MySuntrustHistory, which is multiple suntrust checking historys concatenated. budgettracker uses pandas and plotly to analyze and visualize the spending in my checking account from the past two years.
