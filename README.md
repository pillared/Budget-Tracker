# Budget-Tracker
Decided to analyze my monthly income and spending from my checking account and visualize it.

* Running the budgettracker.ipynb file reads a csv file mySuntrustHistory.csv, which is multiple suntrust checking historys concatenated. 
* Budgettracker uses pandas and plotly to analyze and visualize the spending in my checking account from the past two years.
* All visualizations created in the budgettracker program are saved to /Visializations as .png files.
* Budget Tracker.pdf is a report on what my project could and could not accpomplish.
